# üåç Postalcode Center Finder

**Find the center of multiple locations!**  
This project allows users to input postal codes or city names and calculates the geographic center of those locations. It's a great tool for planning meetups, especially when people have moved to different places but want to find a convenient meeting point. Perfect for reunions, meetups, or any situation where you need to find a midpoint for a group of people. This was created for a school reunion years after.
